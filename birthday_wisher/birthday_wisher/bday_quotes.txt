“Count your life by smiles, not tears. Count your age by friends, not years. Happy birthday!”
"Aapko Janamdin ki Haardik Subhkamnaayein!"
“You’re older today than yesterday but younger than tomorrow, happy birthday!”
“Forget about the past, you can’t change it. Forget about the future, you can’t predict it. And forget about the present, I didn’t get you one. Happy birthday!”
“Happy Birthday! You know, you don’t look that old. But then, you don’t look that young, either.”
“Don’t get all weird about getting older! Our age is merely the number of years the world has been enjoying us!”
“As you get older three things happen. The first is your memory goes, and I can’t remember the other two. Happy birthday!”
“To quote Shakespeare: ‘Party thine ass off!’”
“It’s birthday time again, and wow! You’re a whole year older now! So clown around and have some fun to make this birthday your best one. Happy birthday!”
“Congratulations on being even more experienced. I’m not sure what you learned this year, but every experience transforms us into the people we are today. Happy birthday!”
“Today is your day, live it like you are the king of the world and don’t mind what others say, this day is just for you! Happy birthday.”
